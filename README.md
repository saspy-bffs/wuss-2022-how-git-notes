# Commit early, commit often! A gentle introduction to the joy of Git and GitHub

## A template for taking notes during a Hands-on Workshop at [Western Users of SAS Software](https://www.wuss.org) in San Francisco, California, on September 14, 2022.

#### Main Concepts Covered, following the Step of the "Git Flow"


##### Managing Code Repositories:

- Repo (created using the GitHub web interface, or using the Git CLI with `git init`): Repo is short for code repository (a central location in which data is stored and managed.)

- Fork (typically created using the GitHub web interface only): an independent copy of a repo in github

- Local Clone (typically created using the Git CLI with `git clone` only): 

- Branch (created using the GitHub web interface, or using the Git CLI with `git branch` or `git checkout`): a copy within a repo we can use to make changes


##### Managing Code Edits:

- Stage Changes (typically created using the Git CLI with `git add` only):

- Commit Changes (created using the GitHub web interface, or using the Git CLI with `git commit`): 

- Publish Changes to Remote Clone (typically created using the Git CLI with `git push` only): 

- Pull Request or PR (typically created using the GitHub web interface only): 


#### Additional Git CLI Commands Discussed:

- `git --version`:

- `git --help`:

- `git config`:

- `git status`:


#### Additional Git CLI Commands to Consider Learning (during or after this HOW):

- `git log`:
